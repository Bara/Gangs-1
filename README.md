# [CS:GO] Jailbreak Gangs
This is a gangs plugin designed for Jailbreak servers. Simply put this plugin allows people to create gangs, invite their friends, and work together to unlock perks (health, damage, gravity, speed, gang size).

## Pre-Installation
If you're running one of the supported stores below, go ahead and throw away hl_gangs_credits.smx since you don't need a simple store system. Due to the fact that gang's skill levels depend on credits, I included a default credit system so the plugin works.

### Supported Stores
1) Zephrus's Store
2) Sourcemod Store
3) Frozdark's Store

## Installation
1) Copy all plugin files to their respective places 

2) Add database.cfg entry under hl_gangs

3) Load the plugin in game

4) Create your gangs!

## Problems?
If you have any issues with the plugin, please open a new issue in the issues tab.

## Credits
Special thanks to ThatOneGuy for the database strategy I borrowed from him and thank you to the SourceMod development team for making all of this possible.

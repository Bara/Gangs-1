# [CS:GO] Jailbreak Gangs
This is a gangs plugin that allows people to create gangs and invite their friends! Once members of the gangs gather enough credits/points, they're able to unlock gang powerups! This allows people to get together and have some fun. While this plugin was primarily made for Jailbreak, it can be used in many other scenarios as well! Perks that gangs can work towards include extra health, damage, lower gravity, higher speed, and finally gang size increase! The powerups given are very slight, and do not impede gameplay in any way. Powerups are also disabled when there's only one terrorist left (last request). Give it a try!

## Pre-Installation
If you're running Zephyrus's store plugin, go ahead and throw away hl_gangs_credits.smx since you don't need a simple store system. Due to the fact that gang's skill levels depend on credits, I included a default credit system that is very much so bare bones. This is just so the gangs plugin will work even if you don't have a supported store system.

hl_gangs_credits.smx is designed to have a completely simple system and doesn't require a database entry (it uses hl_gang's database)
## Installation
1) Install plugin into sourcemod/plugins directory

2) Add database.cfg entry under hl_gangs (unless you edited the cvar)

3) Load the plugin in game

4) Create your gangs!

## Problems?
If you have any issues with the plugin, please open a new issue in the issues tab.

## Credits
Special thanks to ThatOneGuy for the database strategy I borrowed from him and thank you to the SourceMod development team for making all of this possible.

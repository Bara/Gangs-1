# [CS:GO] Jailbreak Gangs
by Michael Flaherty

## Pre-Installation
If you're running Zephyrus's store plugin, go ahead and throw away hl_gangs_credits.smx since you don't need a simple store system. Due to the fact that gang's skill levels depend on credits, I included a default credit system that is very much so bare bones. This is just so the gangs plugin will work even if you don't have a supported store system.

hl_gangs_credits.smx is designed to have a completely simple system and doesn't require a database entry (it uses hl_gang's database)
## Installation
1) Install plugin into sourcemod/plugins directory

2) Add database.cfg entry under hl_gangs (unless you edited the cvar)

3) Load the plugin in game

4) Create your gangs!

## Problems?
If you have any issues with the plugin, please open a new issue in the issues tab.

## Credits
Special thanks to ThatOneGuy for the database strategy I borrowed from him and thank you to the SourceMod development team for making all of this possible.
